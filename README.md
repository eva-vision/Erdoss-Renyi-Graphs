# Erdoss-Renyi-Graphs

Simulate Erdős-Rényi graphs. Please implement a code which creates random networks.

Measure the percolation threshold for system sizes 𝑁=10,100,1000

Measure both the size of the infinite component 𝑃∞
 and the average size of the components without the giant component 𝑆

Measure 𝑆(⟨𝑘⟩)
 for different ⟨𝑘⟩
 bearing in mind that the critical average degree is ⟨𝑘⟩=1
. Find the maximum as function of 𝑁
. For this exercise you may use high level connected component finder functions.

Measure the clustering coefficient for the following parameters  𝑁=10,100,1000
, ⟨𝑘⟩=0.5,1,2,4
 (in total 12 value pairs). Do not use high level functions, implement the definition.

Measure the assortativity for 𝑁=10,100,1000
, ⟨𝑘⟩=5
, and plot the average degree of the neighbors as function of the node degree.
Do not forget to use ensemble average, namely, use at least 10 different random realizations!
